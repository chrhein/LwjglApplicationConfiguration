# INF112 roborally game
Much more than a simple skeleton with libgdx. 
### Manual testing:
When running the game you will get prompted to 'PRESS ENTER'. Hitting 'T' instead will launch a test
screen where you can test that ProgramCard and ProgramRegister GUI works as it should. Mouse clicks are
not implemented for the testscreen.


## Known bugs
- Currently throws "WARNING: An illegal reflective access operation has occurred", 
  when the java version used is >8. This has no effect on function or performance, and is just a warning.
