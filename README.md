Much more than a simple skeleton with libgdx. 
### Manual testing:
How to do testing for the TestScreen:
When running the game you will get prompted to 'PRESS ENTER'. Hitting 'T' instead will launch a test
screen where you can test that ProgramCard and ProgramRegister GUI works as it should. Clicking the submit button
when you have chosen five cards is not supposed to do anything here.



## Known bugs
- Currently throws "WARNING: An illegal reflective access operation has occurred", 
  when the java version used is >8. This has no effect on function or performance, and is just a warning.
