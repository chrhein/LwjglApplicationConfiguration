## Part 2: Requirements
- We have finished everyting on the list, except Options, Multiplayer and "smart" Ai's.
We have started on adding Ai's which you can checkout at the Ai robot branch. 
The reason we chose to finish the other requirements on the list, is because we found them more important.
And as a core part of the game.
