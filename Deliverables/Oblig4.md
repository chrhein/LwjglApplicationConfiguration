# Mandatory 4 - LwjglApplicationConfiguration

## Part 1: Project and project structure
- We have chosen William as the designated test person. 
- We are satisfied with how the project methodology has been so far. The choices we've made so far have proved to be good ones. 
Everyone has helped to choose new tasks to be distributed, and this has worked well.
- The group dynamics has so far been great. We have different kinds of expertise, which enables us to do certain tasks better.
- The communication in our group has been great. We show up at meetings and help each other when we have issues. 
- As we mentioned in our earlier presentation; at the beginning of the project we started with a "free-for-all" when doing tasks. This caused that the majority of the project to be written by a few members,
which meant that some members didn't understand how the system worked, and had to read up on it. Last week we started dividing the tasks, and we now have better understanding of the project altogether.
- There is a big difference in commits because of how we started the project, mainly because of the "free-for-all". But also since this is a project where it is actually exciting to work on.
We started the project with having one branch for each person and then merging that into the "dev" branch whenever we finished a task. And then merged "dev" into master when we finished major changes and its stable. We no longer have one branch for each person, but rather one branch for each task. Whenever we finish a task, we merge the branch to dev. And at the end of the cycle we merge dev into master , the commits to master doesn't reflect all of our works.
- We get together every Friday and Wednesday, sometimes Mondays aswell. But we usually just sit together and work on the project, we wouldn't classify that as a "meeting".
We associate meetings as a time when we discuss certain issues together and plan how to work ahead. Which means we have not had a meeting since 8th of February.
- Follow up points:
    - Better communication on Slack
    - Get together more often if needed
    - Continue dividing tasks for each person
    - Commit better and more often
- They group dynamics are fine.
- The communication is still good. We still have meetings regularly, and everyone is active on Slack.

## Part 2: Requirements
- We have finished everything on the list, except option cards, multiplayer and a "smart" AI.
The reason we chose to finish the other requirements on the list, is because we found them more important, and as a core part of the game. 


    
## Part 3: Code
