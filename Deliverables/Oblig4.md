# Mandatory 4 - LwjglApplicationConfiguration

## Part 1: Project and project structure
- We have chosen William as the designated test person. 
- We are satisfied with how the project methodology has been so far. And do not see a reason to change that.
- They group dynamics are fine.
- The communication is still good. We still have meetings regularly, and everyone is active on Slack.
- 


## Part 2: Requirements
- We have finished everything on the list, except option cards, multiplayer and a "smart" AI.
The reason we chose to finish the other requirements on the list, is because we found them more important, and as a core part of the game. 


    
## Part 3: Code
- See README.md for a guide on how to run the program.
