## Part 1: Project and project structure
- We have chosen William as the designated test person. 
- We are satisfied with how the project methodology has been so far. The choices we've made so far have proved to be good ones. 
Everyone has helped to choose new tasks to be distributed, and this has worked well.
- The group dynamics has so far been great. We have different kinds of expertise, which enables us to do certain tasks better.
- The communication in our group has been great. We show up at meetings and help each other when we have issues. 
- Reports from meetings since the previous delivery are added to the folder Meeting Reports in Deliverables.


## Part 2: Requirements
- We have finished everything on the list, except option cards, multiplayer and a "smart" AI.
The reason we chose to finish the other requirements on the list, is because we found them more important, and as a core part of the game. 


    
## Part 3: Code
- See README.md for a step by step guide on how to run the program.
