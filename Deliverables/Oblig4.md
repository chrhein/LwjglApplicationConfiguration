# Mandatory 4 - LwjglApplicationConfiguration

## Part 1: Project and project structure
- We have chosen William as the designated test person. 
- We are satisfied with how the project methodology has been so far. The choices we've made so far have proved to be good ones. 
Everyone has helped to choose new tasks to be distributed, and this has worked well.
- The group dynamics has so far been great. We have different kinds of expertise, which enables us to do certain tasks better.
- The communication in our group has been great. We show up at meetings and help each other when we have issues. 
- We have now finished most of the MVP features, with only a few ones left. 
We have become better at dividing up the tasks in the group, and we are now more aware of what the others are working on. 
Furthermore, the feedback from the last assignment has been taken into account, e.g. we moved the player logic from the board into the player class.
In this cycle we have also done a lot of refactoring, which has also made it easier to understand the structure of the code, both for ourselves and for others.
 - Things to follow up during the next sprint:
    - Improved and more descriptive commit messages
    - Try to stick to our project methodology a little bit closer.  
- Reports from meetings since the previous delivery are added to the folder Meeting Reports in Deliverables.

## Part 2: Requirements
- We have finished everything on the list, except option cards, multiplayer and a "smart" AI.
The reason we chose to finish the other requirements on the list, is because we found them more important, and as a core part of the game.
 - To see tasks completed this iteration, check the "Done in Mandatory 4" column on the GitHub project board.
