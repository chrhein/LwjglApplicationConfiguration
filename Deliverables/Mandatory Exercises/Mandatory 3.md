# Mandatory exercise 3

## Part 1: Project and project structure

How do the roles of the team work? Do you need to update who is teamlead or customer contact? Do
you need other roles? Write down some points about what the different roles actually mean to you.
Are there any experiences either team-wise or regarding project methodology that is worth mentioning?
Does the team think the choices you've made are good? If not, what can you do differently to improve the
way the team works?
How are the group dynamics?
How does communication work for you?
Make a brief retrospective in which you consider what you have done so far and what can be improved.
This is about project structure, not code. You can of course discuss code, but this is not about error
correction, but about how to work and communicate.
During evaluation, every member's contribution to the code base will be emphasized. If there is a big
difference in who commits, you must enclose a brief explanation as to why it is like that. Remember to
commit everything. Including design files.
Report from meetings since the previous delivery must also be delivered.
From the retrospective agree and write down three things (max), that the team will follow up during the
next sprint.

## Part 2: requirements

Clarification of the customer's requirements. What are the actual tasks?
How do the team Prioritize these tasks?
If changes are made in order from what is given by the customer, why is this done?
How will you verify that the requirements are met? (What are the acceptance criteria?)
Update what your priorities are, how far you have come and what you have done since last time.
The list of requirements is long, but it is not necessary to deliver on all requirements if it is not realistic. It is
more important that the tasks that you've executed are of high quality. Regard subproblem 4: "Completed
tasks must be finished."

## Part 3: Code


You need to document how the project builds, tests, and runs such that it's easy to test the code. During
evaluation, the code will also be user tested.
Document how the tests should be run, as well.
Code quality and test coverage are emphasized. Note that the tests you write must be used in the
product.
Completed tasks must be finished.
Deliver class diagrams. (If there are many classes, make class diagrams for the most important ones.)

## Assessment criteria and weighting


There will be no presentation for this delivery.
If the team wants, all text can be delivered in English.




 
Assessment criteria will be published before the deadline.
 
 
Deadline for submission: March 8, 2019, at 4 pm
 
 
To get the thesis approved, the group must:
 
 
Write sensible Commit messages when changes are uploaded in the group's repo.
Upload the requested results in repo.
Upload the delivery to github in markdown format.
Delivery should be uploaded in separate folder in the repo, called "Deliverables". Each oblig becomes
"ObligX.md" in that folder. Any slides can be uploaded to the same folder.
Take a commit of the source code that is the delivery of each oblig. This makes it easier for those who are
considering doing so at the right time. In addition to the code, you will also be evaluated on the
team work throughout the semester.
 
 
To get the assignment approved, each team member must:
 
 
Meet and participate actively in at least 75% of weekly meetings with their TA and oblig.2 presentation.
Perform the assigned tasks during and between these weekly meetings, as agreed by the team.
Report back to the team on progress and / or problems that arise, as agreed in the team.
 
 
Weighting: This delivery counts 12.5% of the final grade.
 
## Tips

Mockito can be a good mock framework in addition to JUnit. In general, it is also possible to write manual tests.
Remember that the tests you write will be used (as mentioned in part 3).
