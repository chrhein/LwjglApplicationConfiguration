# Mandatory 5 - LwjglApplicationConfiguration

## Part 1: Project and project structure
   - The team think that the choices we've made has worked out great. 
   We have had some problems concerning the implementation of multiplayer, 
   but after working hard to solve this issue we achieved a great finished product.
   - The group dynamics has so far been great. We have different kinds of expertise, 
   which enables us to do certain tasks better.
   - The communication in our group has been great. 
   We show up at meetings and help each other when we have issues. 
### Retrospective with a focus on the entire project:
   - In the very beginning we were not very structured and organised. 
   We started with our own branches, and named them after who
   were using it, and not by what feature we were working on. 
   After the first assignment we adjusted this, and started naming them after which features we
   were implementing. This made it much easier for us to know what the others were working on, 
   and it gave us the opportunity to easily access
   the different branches to make small changes and help each other out with problems.
   - One of the things that have worked very well is the attendance on our group meetings. 
   The whole group has showed up to almost every meeting, 
   both the mandatory ones and whenever we met up otherwise.
   - When it comes to the code, it can be mentioned that when someone has worked for 
   a long time on the same branch and has not merged it into dev for a while, 
   some fierce conflicts have arisen that has been time-consuming to solve. <br/>
   We have solved this by more often merging other branches into dev, 
   so it is easier to have an overview of what is and has been worked on.
   - What we are most satisfied with in the game is the graphics. 
   It is very different from the other groups, with its colorful and slightly childish design. 
   It's similar to the kind of graphics one can find in mobile games, 
   and helps reduce stress for the players, even though the stress level can be high 
   when their robots are running out of lives.
   - If we were to further develop the project, the first priority would be to improve 
   the multiplayer functionality. Having the opportunity to play over the Internet, 
   and not just over the LAN, would be a nice addition to our game. <br/>
   With this in place, option cards would be the next on the list, 
   along with other functionality such as statistics in the game, 
   kill cam and animate the lasers that are being shot out.
   - One of the most important things we have learned is how to collaborate 
   and communicate with a team on a project. Our abilities to work together as a team has been
   significantly improved throughout the project. This is the first time for everyone 
   on the group, to be working on a project as big as this with other people.
   We all learned a lot about how to coordinate and work together with each other. <br/>
   Another important thing we have learned, is how to use a version-control system 
   like git when working in a group. In the beginning, we were not so sure how this tool worked, 
   and we rarely dared to push changes without having talked to the rest of the group.
   Later, we have gained better self-confidence in this area, 
   and the whole group has greatly improved their knowledge of git. 


## Part 2: Requirements
   - We have finished everything on the list, although the multiplayer is not completely working.
The reason we chose to finish the other requirements on the list, is because we found them more important, and as a core part of the game.
   - To see tasks completed this iteration, check the "Done in Mandatory 5" column on the GitHub project board.


    
## Part 3: Code
   - See README.md for a step by step guide on how to run the program.
