# Mandatory 5 - LwjglApplicationConfiguration

## Part 1: Project and project structure
- The team think that the choices we've made has worked out great. We have had some problems concerning the implementation of multiplayer, but after working hard to solve this issue we achieved a great finished product.
- The group dynamics has so far been great. We have different kinds of expertise, which enables us to do certain tasks better.
- The communication in our group has been great. We show up at meetings and help each other when we have issues. 
### Retrospective with a focus on the entire project:
   - In the very beginning we were not very structured and organised. We started with our our own branches, and named them after who
   were using it, and not by what feature we were working on. After the first assignment we adjusted this, and started naming them after which features we
   implementing. This made it much easier for us to know what the others were working on, and it gave us the opportunity to easily access
   the different branches to make small changes and to help each other with problems.
   - One of the things that have worked very well is the attendance on our group meetings. Everyone on the group has showed up to almost 
   every meeting, both the mandatory and whenever we met up otherwise.
   - 
   - One of the most important things we have learned is how to collaborate and communicate with a team on a project. Our abilities to work together as a team has been
   significantly improved throughout the project. This is the first time for anyone on the group to be working together with 
   other people on a project as big as this one, so we all learned a lot about how to coordinate and work together with each other. <br/>
   Another important thing we have learned, is how to use a version-control system like Git when working in a group. In the beginning, we were not so sure
   how this tool worked, and we rarely dared to push changes without having heard with the rest of the group.
   if this was a decent thing to change. Later, we have gained better self-confidence in this area, and the whole group
   has greatly improved their knowledge of Git.

## Part 2: Requirements
- We have finished everything on the list, except option cards, multiplayer and a "smart" AI.
The reason we chose to finish the other requirements on the list, is because we found them more important, and as a core part of the game.
 - To see tasks completed this iteration, check the "Done in Mandatory 4" column on the GitHub project board.
