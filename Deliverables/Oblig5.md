# Mandatory 5 - LwjglApplicationConfiguration

## Part 1: Project and project structure
- The team think that the choices we've made has worked out great. We have had some problems concerning the implementation of multiplayer, but after working hard to solve this issue we achieved a great finished product.
- The group dynamics has so far been great. We have different kinds of expertise, which enables us to do certain tasks better.
- The communication in our group has been great. We show up at meetings and help each other when we have issues.

## Part 2: Requirements
- We have finished everything on the list, except option cards, multiplayer and a "smart" AI.
The reason we chose to finish the other requirements on the list, is because we found them more important, and as a core part of the game.
